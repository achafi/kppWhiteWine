supervised learning: Kpp 

We are interested in building Kpp/Knn (k nearest neighbor) method to predict the quality of a wine from physical and chemical characteristics.
The data used is the WaiteW.mat . Information on this data is available at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality.
The matrix X contains the physical and chemical attributes  while vector Y contains the wine category (good or bad quality).
